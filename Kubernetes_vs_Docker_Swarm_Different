-Developed by 	        Docker Inc 	                 Google

-Year Released 	        2013 	                        2014
Scaling 	          No Autoscaling 	                    Auto-scaling

-Cluster Setup 	    Setting up the cluster   	        Setting up the cluster is simple.   
                    is challenging & complicated.       Requires only two commands.
                    Cluster Strength is stronger.       Cluster Strength not as strong

-Installation 	    Easy & fast 	                    Complicated & time-consuming.

-Data volume 	    Shares storage volumes between      Shares storage volumes with any 
                    multiple containers in              other container
                    the same Pod.

-Support for       	Allows you to use a . 	             It offers an in-built tool for 
logging and         3rd party tool like ELK              logging and monitoring.   
monitoring tool

-Load balancing 	Does auto load-balancing 	        Manually configure your load balancing settings


-Scalability 	    Scaling up is faster than K8S.  	Scaling up is slow compared to docker.
                    But, it's cluster strength          However, guarantees stronger cluster state 
                    is not as robust.                   Load balancing needs manual service configuration.

-Updates 	        Agent update can be performed    	A cluster can be upgraded in place.
                    in place.


-Optimized For 	    Optimized for a single              Optimized for multiple smaller clusters of SDLC
                    large cluster 

-Tolerance ratio 	High fault tolerance 	            Low fault tolerance

-Node Support 	    Supports 2000 > nodes 	            Supports up to 5000 nodes

-Container Limit 	Limited to 95000 container 	        Limited to 300000 containers

-Public cloud         	Azure only. 	                Google, Azure, and AWS.

-Slave 	            Worker 	                            Nodes

-Compatibility 	    Less extensive and customizable 	More comprehensive and highly customizable

-Community 	        An active user base which        	Offers strong support from open source
                    regularly updates the software.     communities and big companies like Google, 
                                                        Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM

-Large clusters 	    Speed is considered             	Offers container deployment and scaling, 
                    or the strong cluster states.       even in large clusters without considering the speed.    

-Companies using 	Spotify, Pinterest,              	9GAG, Intuit, Buffer, Evernote, etc.
                    eBay, Twitter, etc.
