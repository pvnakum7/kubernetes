10 most common mistakes using kubernetes



1. resources - requests and limits

(please don't):
    -- resources: {}
    -- resources:
        requests:
            cpu: "1m"
  ---You can see the current cpu and memory usage of pods
        kubectl top pods
        kubectl top pods --containers
        kubectl top nodes

 2. liveness and readiness probes

    People usually don't know the difference between these two.

---->Liveness probe restarts your pod if the probe fails
---->Readiness probe disconnects on fail the failing pod from the kubernetes
service (you can check this in kubectl get endpoints) and no more 
traffic is being sent to it until the probe succeeds again       

3. LoadBalancer for every http service



4.non-kubernetes-aware cluster autoscaling

5.Not using the power of IAM/RBAC

6. self anti-affinities for pods
    Running e.g. 3 pod replicas of some deployment, node goes down 
    and all the replicas with it. Huh? All the replicas were running
    on one node? Wasn't Kubernetes supposed to be magical and provide
    HA(High Availability)?!
7. more tenants or envs in shared cluster

8. externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster

9. pet clusters + stressing the control plane too much

10.bonus: using latest tag
