# tolerations pod kubernetes

#-->Tolerations for PODS
#Node affinity, is a property of Pods that attracts them to a set of nodes 
#(either as a preference or a hard requirement).
#Taints are the opposite â€“ they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "node.kubernetes.io/unreachable"           #"example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
    tolerationSeconds: 3600




#    also use equal tolerations
    tolerations:
#    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/unreachable""
#    operator: "Equal"
#    value: "value"
#    effect: "NoSchedule"



#and A Pod has Two Tolerations:

#    tolerations:
#    - key: "key1"
#    operator: "Equal"
#    value: "value1"
#    effect: "NoSchedule"
#    - key: "key1"
#    operator: "Equal"
#    value: "value1"
#    effect: "NoExecute"



#The NoExecute taint effect, mentioned above, affects pods that are already running on the node as follows

#--->    pods that do not tolerate the taint are evicted immediately
#---->    pods that tolerate the taint without specifying tolerationSeconds 
#       in their toleration specification remain bound forever
# ---->  pods that tolerate the taint with a specified tolerationSeconds 
#        remain bound for the specified amount of time
